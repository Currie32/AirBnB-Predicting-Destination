# AirBnB-Predicting-Destination

I used TensorFlow to build a neural network that can predict which country a new AirBnB user will book their first trip to. This data was originally used for a Kaggle competition in 2016: https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings. Despite the competition having ended over a year ago, this data is still an excellent learning resource because of the opportunity to clean data, engineering features, and build a neural network. An additional benefit is being able to compare my predictions to others, which allows me to understand my performance, and motivate me to improve my analysis.
